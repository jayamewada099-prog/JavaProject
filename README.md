Student Grade Management System
This is a simple Java console project built to practice Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and exception handling.
The project allows a user to enter basic student details, validate marks, and calculate a grade based on the input.

It was created as a beginner‑friendly assignment after learning the fundamentals of classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and custom exceptions.
